# To-do List

This application implements a simple to-do list application
using Django as a restful backend.

## Running

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
   and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Clone this repository.  All remaining instructions assume you are in the
   project directory. (For example, if I run clone it to my home directory,
   `~`, then the directions assume that my current working directory is
   `~/todo_list`.)

3. Bring the containers up:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Check out the app by going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
